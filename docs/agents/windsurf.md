# Windsurf

MCP over stdio, through Cascade.

## Prerequisites

```bash
npx linkedin-toolkit-mcp
```

First run prints a pairing token. Open the extension popup → Settings → paste it → Connect. The
status dot goes green when the bridge is up. That is a one-time step; after it, the command above
is all any client needs.

## Config

`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin-toolkit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "linkedin-toolkit-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Windsurf Settings → Cascade → MCP Servers → *Add Server* edits the same file, and *Refresh*
reloads it without restarting the editor.

Note that Windsurf counts each tool call as a Cascade action. A sourcing run is ten to fifteen
calls, so budget accordingly.

## Verify

Ask for the status:

```
What's my LinkedIn Toolkit status?
```

You should get quota numbers, whether Autopilot is on, and the queue depth. If you get
`EXTENSION_OFFLINE`, Chrome is closed or the pairing token has not been entered.

## What you get

39 tools, 4 resources (`linkedin://status`, `linkedin://queue`, `linkedin://list/{listId}`,
`linkedin://profile/{publicId}`) and 3 prompts (`source-candidates`, `write-opener`,
`triage-inbox`). Full list in [`../tools.md`](../tools.md).

Every write queues for your approval in the extension popup until you turn Autopilot on yourself.
That is the default and you should leave it that way for a while.
